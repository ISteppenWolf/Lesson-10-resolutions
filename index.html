 	    <p class="text"><span class="name">Geralt of Rivia</span> was a witcher, Ciri's adoptive father, and despite their tumultuous relationship, loved the <span>sorceress Yennefer</span>, who was considered the love of his life.

        During the <span>Trial of the Grasses</span>, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the <span>mutagens</span> that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and <span>stamina</span> than his fellow witchers.

        Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of <span>Rivia</span>. After being left with the witchers by his mother, <span>Visenna</span>, he grew up in their keep of <span>Kaer Morhen</span> in the realm of <span>Kaedwen</span>. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master <span>Vesemir</span>. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic.

        Later, <span>Queen Meve</span> of <span>Lyria</span> knighted him for his valour in the <span>Battle for the Bridge</span> on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him. He, therefore, became a true <span>knight</span> of Lyria, only to lose the title soon after for departing.

        Geralt was the son of the <span>sorceress</span> Visenna and, presumably, the warrior <span>Korin</span>, but when he was born Visenna left him with the <span>School of the Wolf</span> at Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was trained and made to be a witcher. He survived the many blistering mutations required to grant witchers their abilities and passed the Trial of the Grasses. Geralt's intensive training, and the mutagenic experimentation carried out upon him, have granted him considerably greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and an extreme resistance to pain.
        
        During his training at the witcher school, he made friends with several students, such as <span>Gweld</span> and <span>Eskel</span>, and was trained by Vesemir in harsh conditions, one in which resulted in a student dying.
        
        Geralt was eventually put through the <span>Trial of Forest Eyes</span>, where he was left tied up in the woods and blindfolded and needed to return to the keep by the morning or he would fail. He was helped out of his binds by the <span>elf Aideen</span>, where they went to look at the <span>non-human</span> reservation to find the camp had been attacked by <span>vrans</span>. They then left and came across some <span>Cat School</span> witchers training and wrestling. Aideen then unbound Geralt and left him to return to his master.</p>
